## Deploy instructions (quick)

Option A — GitHub + Cloudflare Pages (recommended)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., herbalhomeschool-pages).
2. Upload all files in this ZIP to the repo root (index.html, assets/..., README.md).
3. In Cloudflare dashboard -> Pages -> Create project -> Connect to GitHub and select this repo.
4. Build settings: Framework preset: None. Build command: (leave blank). Build output folder: /
5. Deploy. Your site will be available at https://<project>.pages.dev (or map custom domain).

Option B — Manual upload using Cloudflare Pages UI (if supported)
1. In Cloudflare Pages, create a new project, choose 'Upload' (if available) and paste index.html as the site root.
2. Publish.

Form submission (activate waitlist):
- Create a free Formspree form at https://formspree.io and copy your form ID.
- Open index.html and find the line: action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID"
- Replace YOUR_FORMSPREE_ID with the ID provided by Formspree.
- Commit and redeploy.

Notes on the Pay Stub Calculator:
- The coming-soon page links to the existing live calculator. Keep the calculator repo and Cloudflare Pages deployment backed up in GitHub and locally to ensure you can restore if needed.
